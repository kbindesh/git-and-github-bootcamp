GIT FETCH
--------------
1) Let us create a file called demo.txt
   
git init
git add <Filename>
git commit -m <Commit Message
git remote add origin <Link to your remote repository>
git push origin <branch name>

Now, we have my demo.txt in the remote repository. 


2) The local and the remote repositories are now in sync.

- Let’s now update our demo.txt in the remote repository(github).

3) Now since we have updated our demo.txt remotely, let’s bring the changes to our local repository.

Let’s use the git fetch command to see in the local repository whether we have a change in the remote repository or not.

git log

git fetch

4) To merge these changes into our local repository, we need to use command:

git merge origin/master 

- Let us have a look at our commits in the local repository using the git log command.
And we got our remote repository commit in our local repository. 

============================================================
GIT PULL 

- Git Pull command is used to fetch all changes from the remote repository to the current working directory. 

- It automatically try to merge or rebase them into our current working directory. 
- It is the combination of git fetch and git merge 

1) Let’s make more changes to our demo.txt file at the remote repository.

2) Now, we have 3 commits at our remote repository whereas 2 commits at our local repository. 

3) Let us now bring this change to our local repository using the git pull origin <branch name> command.

- We can see that with the help of just git pull command, we directly fetched and merged our remote repository with the local repository.

4) Let us see what our demo.txt in the local repository looks like –
