# Get help from Git (man pages)

- Git has a built-in `help` function that you can use to look up commands and keywords.

```
git --help

# Read through the different options available with Git and note that each command comes with its own help page
```

**Examples**

```
# To get help around git commit command
git commit --help

# To get help around git clone command
git clone --help
```
